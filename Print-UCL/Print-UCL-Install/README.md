# print@UCL Installer
This directory contains an application in a ZIP file to install the print@UCL drivers and print queue. It also contains the AppleScript Bundle contained in this application.

Please note that after using the installer, the first time you print you will be prompted to install additional drivers from Apple. This ensures the latest Xerox support software from Apple is installed, and keeps this installer lightweight.
