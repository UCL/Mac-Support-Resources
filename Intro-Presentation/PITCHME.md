# UCL Mac Support Service
Introduction and Q/A
by Alex Uhde

## Accessibility
Just as Apple puts accessibility first in the design of their products, at every stage of the project we are committed to ensuring accessibility.
---
## A bit more modest than you might be expecting
We're looking to create a solid foundation for Mac support service across UCL, and we're taking the time to get things right and support what we currently have. We look forward to even greater things to come, so watch this space!

## The 'Big Five'
- Remote Access (VPN and Desktop@UCL Anywhere remote desktop) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Network (eduroam and Ethernet) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- live@UCL (Email and Calendar from Office 365) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- print@UCL (central Xerox managed print service) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Filestore@UCL (central NetApp file storage) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Why do the 'big five' matter?
- Widely-used <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Relied-upon <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Critical to other services <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### What are we offering for the 'big five'?
These five services will receive full support from ISD. Our focus is on how we can best support these services for everyone across UCL.
+++
### Some Challenges
We've had to fight some major roadblocks (DFS, eduroam, etc)
---
## macOS
In order to support these five services, we'll also need to know and understand how to use the Mac itself. Training has been offered to interested ISD staff to familiarise them with macOS.
---
## Collaborative Effort
We have put together some resources to help everyone supporting Macs at UCL work collaboratively and help us avoid repeating work.
+++
### GitHub
All the materials we have created are hosted on GitHub, where you'll find detailed help and resources for using them. Please feel free to raise issues on GitHub, we are working on these actively.

### NoMAD
The project GitHub repo contains a config file for NoMAD to customise it for UCL. This is provided with no ISD support, but we're happy to help as a project if you want to roll it out.
