# VPN
This directory contains information to help you support users of the UCL Cisco AnyConnect VPN on Mac. Read this FAQ if you are unsure, then proceed to [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) to connect a user to the UCL VPN.

## Is VPN the right answer?
To decide if VPN is the right solution for a given user, first you need to understand what it is and when to use it and not to use it.

### What is VPN?
VPN (Virtual Private Networking) is a method for users to connect to a private network by creating a 'tunnel' through the global public Internet (or through another private network in some circumstances). For the context of this document, UCL VPN is referring to the central VPN service offered to all UCL users that puts their computer inside the UCL network.

*When connected to the UCL Remote Access VPN Service, ALL your traffic will be sent through
the UCL network, regardless of whether the destination is a UCL address or an address on the
Internet.
All users must be aware of this fact and abide by the UCL Computing Regulations and the Janet
Acceptable Use Policy when connecting to the Remote Access VPN Service.*

### When to use the UCL VPN?
Use the UCL VPN when a user wants to put their computer on the UCL network from home. This is an excellent solution for when a user's computer is already set up to connect to the UCL services they want to use (e.g. Filestore@UCL).

However, VPN doesn't automatically 'just work' - users still need to set up the individual services they want. UCL doesn't automatically give access to UCL software, or to the Desktop@UCL Windows environment.

The benefit to VPN is that the user receives a native Mac experience and excellent performance.

### When not to use the UCL VPN?
If the goal of a user is to see the Desktop@UCL Windows environment, or use UCL software, the [Desktop@UCL Anywhere remote desktop service](../Desktop-Anywhere) is a more appropriate solution. This gives the user their Desktop@UCL profile in a Citrix remote desktop environment.
