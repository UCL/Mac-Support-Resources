# Connecting to the UCL VPN
## Caution
When connected to the UCL Remote Access VPN Service, ALL your traffic will be sent through
the UCL network, regardless of whether the destination is a UCL address or an address on the
Internet.
All users must be aware of this fact and abide by the UCL Computing Regulations and the Janet
Acceptable Use Policy when connecting to the Remote Access VPN Service.

## Pre-requisites
The UCL VPN has two pre-requisites that must be met:

### Cisco AnyConnect Client
To connect to the UCL VPN, users will need the [Cisco AnyConnect Client configured for UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/how-to/remote-working/resources/apple/anyconnect-mac-predeploy.dmg). This client allows the computer to connect to the UCL VPN.

#### Installation Note
When installing the client, install only the client itself and the posture module. No other modules are needed.

### Anti-virus Software
The user will also need to install UCL-approved anti-virus software. This software must be kept updated. UCL provides [Sophos](http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/package/view/id/322?filter=sophos) free of charge to meet this requirement.

## Connecting
1. Open the Cisco AnyConnect Client.
2. Enter `vpn.ucl.ac.uk` for the server name.
3. Click 'Connect'.
4. Enter the following details:
  - Group: RemoteAccess
  - Username: UCL userID
  - Password: UCL Password
5. Click 'OK'.

## Disconnecting
When finished, click 'Disconnect' to disconnect. Ensure users know they must disconnect when done, and that all their traffic will go through the UCL network until they do so!
