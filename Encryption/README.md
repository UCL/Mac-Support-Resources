# Encryption
This directory contains resources to assist with the use of FileVault 2 disk encryption.

## Scripts
The shell scripts contained in this directory are used to enable FileVault 2 encryption. Please note that both scripts with 'Institutional' in the name need to be ran from the same directory as your public institutional recovery key (FileVaultMaster.keychain). For more information on how to create this key, please see [Apple HT202385](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202385).

For more information on how to customise the behaviour of fdesetup, please see the fdesetup man page by typing `man fdesetup` at the terminal.

## ISG Policy
This information and these scripts are intended to be used in a way that supports UCL information security [policy on encryption](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/informationsecurity/itsecurity/knowledgebase/securitybaselines/encryption). Please read and understand these policies and how they apply to your use case.
