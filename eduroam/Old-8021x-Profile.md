# Removing Old 802.1x Profiles
If a user came to UCL from a different university, or possibly if they used a very old UCL eduroam installer, they may have an 802.1x profile for the previous eduroam-participating institution, and they may be unable to connect to eduroam at UCL.

1. Click the Apple menu.
