# Built-In Accessibility Features
## Overview
This document will cover the built in assistive technology included in the Accessibility preference pane, and other places in macOS.

### Finding Accessibility
1. Click on the Apple menu in the top-left corner of the screen.
2. Click 'System Preferences'
3. Click 'Accessibility' - by default, this will be in the bottom row, unless additional preference panes have been added.

### General Configuration
If the user will be using the Accessibility functions regularly, they may benefit from ticking 'Show Accessibility status in menu bar'.
Tick only the features they will be using under keyboard shortcuts, this will simplify use for them.

## Vision
These features are designed to help users with visual difficulties to use their Mac. Many of these features are useful for non-visually impaired users in certain circumstances. Additionally, others, such as users with dyslexia may find them beneficial.

### VoiceOver
VoiceOver is used to control the computer. It provides spoken or brailled descriptions of items on the computer screen, and it provides for control using the keyboard (to eliminate the Mac's mouse dependency).

VoiceOver provides built-in training.

### Zoom
Zoom does what it says, it allows a user to set up zoom shortcuts for times they need to see something up close. While documented and provided as an assistive feature, this feature can also benefit graphic designers and others who want to be able to zoom in on any part of their screen (e.g. to look closely at UI controls).

### Display
Here you will find a number of features designed to make the screen easier on the eyes, and easier to read. This is also where you'll find features for colour-blind users, users who get motion sickness looking at their screen, and anyone who just generally finds the Mac screen difficult to read.

Caution is needed for anyone who needs colour accuracy, as these features will prevent colour accuracy.

### Speech
Here a user can change the voice and speed of their computer's default speech, they can also enable spoken announcements and a simple text reader that enables them to read a selected block of text.

## Media
This section contains features that affect media playback.

### Descriptions
Enables audio descriptions of visual content.

### Captions
This section allows you to configure the system default subtitle and caption style. This is also where the option to prefer captions/SDH (subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing) over standard subtitles (when both are available) exists. SDH contain descriptions of sounds, not just dialogue.

## Hearing
This section contains options intended to help users who are deaf and hard of hearing.

### Audio
This simple section has two options, both of which can be quite useful for hearing users as well. Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs enables the screen to flash whenever an alert would normally play. Play stereo audio as mono ensures that a user with hearing in only one ear, or an assistive system that is mono, hears both tracks. It is also quite useful for presentation environments where only a single channel may be connected, to ensure nothing is missing.

## Interacting
This section controls how a user interacts with their computer.

### Dictation
Dictation allows a user to speak to their computer. Dictation is controlled by a separate preference pane, this section is designed to enable dictation commands. Dictation commands allow a user to control their computer and to edit text by speaking commands, whereas standard Dictation is simply a text entry method.

To use the features in this section, Enhanced Dictation must be enabled in the Dictation preference pane, which this section links to.

### Keyboard
This is where you will find options for Sticky Keys (which allows modifier keys to be pressed in sequence instead of held down) and Slow Keys (which creates a delay to prevent accidental triggering of a key). Inside Slow Keys, you can also enable a key click sound for users to get additional audio feedback.

### Mouse & Trackpad
This section enabled the mouse pointer to be controlled with the keyboard through a function called Mouse Keys. This is also where you can adjust the spring-loading delay (time for a folder to spring load when a file is dragged over it). Finally, if a user is accidentally triggering the built-in trackpad, and they never use it, it can be disabled (as long as another mouse is present) here.

### Switch Control
This allows users with physical challenges to use switches to control the computer. These are generally rather advanced and bespoke setups, and the user will know what they need. If you have a user who needs switch control, please seek additional assistance if needed from the provider of their control system or from an assistive technology expert.

### Dwell Control
Like switch control, this is an advanced feature for bespoke setups created with the needs of the user, an assistive technology expert other members of a team. Again, if you need additional help with this, please do see an assistive technology expert.
