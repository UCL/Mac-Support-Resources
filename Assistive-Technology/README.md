# Assistive Technology
This directory contains information to help you support users of assistive technology on Mac.

## Built-In Features
macOS has excellent (built-in accessibility features)[Built-in-Features.md] and these features should be your first 'go-to' place for meeting many users' needs. Please ensure that when managing Macs, you don't do anything to prevent users from accessing these features. People with a need for these features should not need to identify themselves, as would be required if they needed to speak to an administrator to access these features.
