# Read&Write
## What is it?
Read&Write is a literacy software program created by TextHelp. It is primarily marketed for English Language Learners and young children, but is also extremely popular among people with dyslexia and others who have visual processing or assistive technology needs.
## What does it do?
The full feature set is beyond the scope of this document, but it provides a wide toolkit that meets a number of literacy needs including:
1. Screen reading
2. Screen masking (coloured tint and highlighting)
3. Text highlighting
4. Dictionary and translator
5. Similar word checking (assists with issues such as homophones)
6. Global spell checking
7. And far, far more than I can get into here - check it out
## How do I install it?
You can download Read&Write from the [UCL Software Database](http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/package/view/id/474) or directly from [the TextHelp website](https://www.texthelp.com/en-gb/products/read-write/).
## How do I activate it?
