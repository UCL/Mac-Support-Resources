# Desktop@UCL Anywhere
This directory contains information to help you support users of Desktop@UCL Anywhere on macOS.

## What is Desktop@UCL Anywhere?
Desktop@UCL Anywhere is a remote desktop service that allows users to access a Microsoft Windows (currently Server 2008) environment using the same profile used on Desktop@UCL Windows computers on campus.

Desktop@UCL Anywhere is a Citrix-based environment, and can run using either the Citrix Receiver client, or using a purely web technology-based client, completely self-contained in any modern, full-featured browser.

## Who should use Citrix Receiver?
For many use cases, Citrix Receiver is unnecessary, and the 'light version' is completely suitable. If a user simply wants to access an on-campus computer, the browser-based version will meet all their needs.

The browser-based client is almost completely sandboxed and has minimal integration (clipboard) with the host computer. However, users may want to access files or printers on their computer from inside the Desktop@UCL Anywhere environment. This is where Citrix Receiver becomes useful, because the Citrix Receiver client is able to access these things, and present them to the Desktop@UCL Anywhere environment.

The [Citrix Receiver Feature Matrix](https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/products-solutions/citrix-receiver-feature-matrix.pdf) provides details of the features available on each platform, however please remember that many of these features do not apply to Desktop@UCL Anywhere and most are unlikely to apply to any given user. Thus, simply having 'more features' is not necessarily better for the user.

## Where can I get Citrix Receiver?
The latest version of [Citrix Receiver](https://www.citrix.co.uk/downloads/citrix-receiver/) can be downloaded from Citrix's website.
