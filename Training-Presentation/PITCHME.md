## macOS Support
In order to support services on Mac, we must provide basic support for Macs themselves.

### Assistive Technology
Apple puts accessibility at the forefront in all they do, and we should aim to do the same. Every student, every researcher, every staff member, every person on Earth deserves the same opportunities to learn, work and grow. We should support all users in any way necessary to have the technology they need to thrive.
