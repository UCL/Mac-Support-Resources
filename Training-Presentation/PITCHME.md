+++
### Then why are we here?
Students and education. We're here to support the teaching and research of UCL. Our students and staff come with Apple products, we need to ensure we're giving them the tools to make IT accessible to them, where they are. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### What are we offering for the 'big five'?
These five services will receive full support from ISD. We're here today mainly to learn about how we can better support and troubleshoot these services for our users.

## macOS Support
In order to support services on Mac, we must provide basic support for Macs themselves.
+++
### Assistive Technology
Apple puts accessibility at the forefront in all they do, and we should aim to do the same. Every student, every researcher, every staff member, every person on Earth deserves the same opportunities to learn, work and grow. We should support all users in any way necessary to have the technology they need to thrive.
+++
### Keychain Management
Often, users can't do anything with their Mac because of Keychain issues. Here are some strategies for managing this problem today.
+++
### Encryption
Many people need to have full disk encryption to meet security requirements. Almost all users should have it. Let's discuss when to use it, when not to use it (rare!) and how to use it.
+++
### Profile Migration
There are multiple cases where a user may need to migrate their home folder from one computer to another, or from one account to another on the same computer (e.g. from a local account to a domain account).
