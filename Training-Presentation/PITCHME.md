Students and education. We're here to support the teaching and research of UCL. Our students and staff come with Apple products, we need to ensure we're giving them the tools to make IT accessible to them, where they are. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## What are we offering for the 'big five'?
These five services will receive full support from ISD. We're here today mainly to learn about how we can better support and troubleshoot these services for our users.

Other services will be supported on a best-efforts basis only, however it is acknowledged that some basic macOS support must go with that, so it will also be covered today.
