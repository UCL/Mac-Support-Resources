# Mac-Training
Training Materials for the Mac Support Project

This repository contains training, tools and documentation for the UCL Mac Support Service. The aim of this service is to raise the standard of support for Apple macOS devices across the UCL campus by providing the documentation, support and resources needed for both the central ISD Service Desk and various local departmental IT support teams to fully support their Mac users.

These materials are intended for use by UCL IT technicians, but everyone is welcome here.
